# Java Type Casting

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting: 

* **Widening Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size `byte` -> `short` -> `char` -> `int` -> `long` -> `float` -> `double`

* **Narrowing Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type `double` -> `float` -> `long` -> `int` -> `char` -> `short` -> `byte`
