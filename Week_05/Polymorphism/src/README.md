# Java Polymorphism 

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have classes that are related to each other by inheritance. 

Like we specified in the previous chapter, **Inheritance** lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. **Polymorphism** uses those methods to perform different task. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 

For example, think of a superclass called `Animal` that has a method called `animalSound()`. Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.).
